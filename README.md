I was born in the same year that George Orwell's '1984' was set in, a book that imagined an apocalyptic society. Throughout my life, I've had a tendency towards suffering which led me down three distinct paths: a do-it-yourself musical career in punk rock, a passion for Russian literature, and a desire to program.

Despite studying journalism, I came to realize that it was not the career for me. I spent some time traveling around the world, searching for something that would fulfill my dreams and passions. In 2020, I discovered <Academia de CÃ³digo\_>, which changed my life. I made the adventurous decision to leave South America, where I had lived for six years, and return to my Azorean motherland to become a Junior Full Stack Developer.

After completing the <A/C\_> bootcamp in 2021, I was one step closer to achieving my dream. My previous nihilistic Sartrean perspective on life disappeared. Now, I'm ready for the big challenge that awaits me as I code the next chapter of my life at Bring Global.

I'm excited to tackle this challenge and see what new opportunities arise.
