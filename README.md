George Orwell wrote ‚Äú1984‚Äù. The author described an apocalyptic society but, nevertheless, something unexpected was about to happen that year. And thus, Paulo Lemos was born.

Because of his inclination towards suffering, three were destined to happen: a do-it-yourself musical career in punk rock, a passion for Russian literature and the desire to program.

Even though Paulo has studied Journalism, the fact is that this career was never meant to be. Because of this, he has worked around the globe and travelled quite a bit: always searching for something that would fulfill his dreams and passion.

Hence, in 2020 <Academia de C√≥digo_> appeared in his life and, therefore, a wild but brave decision was taken.

He would leave South America, after living there for 6 years, and would return to his Azorean motherland in order to be a Junior Full Stack Developer.

In 2021, after taking <A/C_> bootcamp, he was one step closer to achieving his dream and, consequently, his nihilistic Sartre‚Äôs existentialism perspective on life disappeared.

And now, the big challenge appeared and we shall code together the next chapter of Paulo‚Äôs book of life. And this will happen at Bring Global company.
